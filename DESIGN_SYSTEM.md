# Design System - Modern & Refined

## Typography

### Fonts
- **Primary**: Manrope - Modern, geometric sans-serif with excellent readability
- **Display**: Space Grotesk - Unique, slightly quirky for headings
- Both fonts have excellent character spacing and modern feel

### Hierarchy
- Headings use display font for more personality
- Body text uses Manrope for optimal readability
- Improved letter-spacing for better visual rhythm

## Color Palette

### Neutral Foundation (Stone)
- Warm, sophisticated grays instead of cold blues
- Stone-50 to Stone-900 scale
- Creates a more premium, organic feel

### Accent Colors
- **Sage** (#87a96b) - Soft, natural green
